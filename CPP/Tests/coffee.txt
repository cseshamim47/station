Hello Sir/Madam,
I have managed an internship opportunity from a good company in Dhaka. I have completed 121 credits and willing to take 12 credits including internship in upcoming semester(summer 22-23). As I have 27 credits left to graduate and already got an internship offer, I would like to utilize this opportunity by taking the internship in summer semester so that I can graduate before Spring 23-24. If I do not get this opportunity, Iâ€™ll have to do an extra semester only for internship and also finding an internship might be difficult at that time. 

I kindly request your support and approval in granting me the internship opportunity during the summer semester. I assure you that I will fulfill all academic requirements associated with the internship, maintaining a balance between my internship responsibilities and my coursework. I understand the importance of maintaining high academic standards, and I am committed to upholding the reputation of AIUB throughout my internship.

Regards,
Md Shamim Ahmed
